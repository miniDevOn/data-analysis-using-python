# Data Analysis for used car dataset
## DataSet Overview
###### The dataset is taken from kaggle and contains details of the used cars in germany which are on sail on ebay. 
The dataset is not clean and hence a lot of data cleaning is carried out. For e.g. prices where too high which are replaced
by the median and outliers are removed accordingly. Also vehicles whose registration year was greater than 2016 and less than 
1890 were removed from the dataset as this data is inconsistense and would yield incorrect results.
