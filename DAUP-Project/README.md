###### DataPreparation folder
###### Folder for RawData
###### Folder for Cleaned Data which consists of the entire cleaned dataset named as cleaned_autos.csv and another subfolder consisting of the subsets made as per brands and vehicle types
###### Folder for shell scripts which automate the creation of data structure and also subsets the dataset as said above
## Analysis 1
###### This gives the distribution for the prices of the vehicles which varies over vehicle type. This plot is achieved after cleaning a lot data without which the boxplot was barely visible due to a lot of outliers.
#### Histogram Indicating a lot outliers and inconsistent data as car registration year cannot be greater than 2016 and less than 1890 (assuming the first car ever made was in 1885)
